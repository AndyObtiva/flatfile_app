# Flatfile App

This is a web application prototype that demoes how to use https://flatfile.com csv/xlsx import service.

It supports [Embed](https://flatfile.com/docs/getting-started/) and [Portal](https://flatfile.com/developers/) Imports.

[Embed](https://flatfile.com/docs/getting-started/) is more basic. [Portal](https://flatfile.com/developers/) is more advanced and supports field alternates.

Examples:
- Embed Import of [example1.xlsx](/example1.xlsx) results in [example1.json](/example1.json)
- Portal Import of [example2.csv](/example2.csv) results in [example2.json](/example2.json)
